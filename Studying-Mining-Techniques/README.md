                        Credit Scoring Data – Studying Logistic Regression and Classification Tree
                                                    Summary
Background: 
Credit scoring can be defined as a technique that helps credit providers decide whether to grant credit to 
consumers or customers. Its increasing importance can be seen from the growing popularity and application of credit scoring
in consumer credit. There are advantages not only to construct effective credit scoring models to help improve 
the bottom-line of credit providers, but also to combine models to yield a better performing combined model.
Goal: 
The goal of this exercise is to illustrate the use of data mining techniques to construct credit scoring models and then 
compare these techniques in order to find how well the models can predict defaulters. 
Approach:
In this exercise we use Logistic Regression and Classification Tree techniques to build credit scoring models. 
The output of both of these models is binary i.e. (1 or 0, 1 – bad, 0 - good). 
Major Findings: 
As a result of this exercise we found out that the logistic regression models are simple and can be easily interpreted when
the number of explanatory variables is large.
On the other hand, Classification trees can get really deep and complex, which can cause an over fit. 
We have to rely on pruning the tree to resolve this issue. Also Classification tree is a great Exploratory Data Analysis
method as we can visualize and interpret a data set even with a large number of predictor variables.
